## Introduction:

In the dynamic landscape of online platforms, understanding user behavior is pivotal for strategic decision-making and maximizing business outcomes. The intersection of machine learning and business intelligence opens avenues for predicting user actions, providing companies with the foresight to tailor their approach. This project stems from the need to forecast the likelihood of a student transitioning from a free plan to a subscription on a EdTech platform, leveraging insights derived from their engagement metrics.

## Project Overview:

- Inspiration:

The genesis of this endeavor traces back to a 2022 initiative by a EdTech Platform, aimed at anticipating student purchases prior to the Black Friday campaign. The objective was clear: create a targeted list of potential subscribers and craft personalized ad campaigns on social media platforms. To achieve this, I delved into the world of student activities on the platform, scrutinizing factors such as time spent, content consumption, and course participation.

- Data Exploration:

The first step involved a meticulous examination of student engagement metrics. The dataset encapsulated crucial information like the number of days a student spent on the platform, the minutes devoted to content consumption, and the count of initiated courses. These metrics, reflective of user interaction, formed the bedrock for subsequent machine learning endeavors.

- Modeling Techniques:

Armed with insightful data, I ventured into the realm of classification models. Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests models. The goal was clear: predict whether students would make the leap from free to paid plans. Each model underwent meticulous fine-tuning, exploring hyperparameters to unearth their optimal configurations.

- Business Significance:

The implications of this analysis are profound for any online entity. The ability to forecast potential customers empowers companies to refine advertisement targeting and extend exclusive offers to a select audience. This, in turn, optimizes budget allocation, directing resources towards users with a higher likelihood of converting, thereby augmenting the company's revenue streams.

## Conclusion:

Through the synthesis of machine learning methodologies and business objectives, this project not only presents a solution to a specific challenge faced by this platform but serves as a testament to the broader potential of data-driven decision-making in the online realm. The journey from data exploration to model selection encapsulates the iterative nature of such endeavors, where refinement and adaptation lead to actionable insights. The findings not only contribute to the optimization of marketing strategies but underscore the transformative power of machine learning in shaping the future of online businesses.
